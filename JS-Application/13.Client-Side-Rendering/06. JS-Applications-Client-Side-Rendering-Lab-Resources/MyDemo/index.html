        <p>“You can talk with someone for years, everyday, and still,
             it won't mean as much as what you can have when you sit in front of 
             someone, not saying a word, yet you feel that person with your heart,
              you feel like you have known the person for forever.... connections are 
              made with the heart, not the tongue.”</p>
